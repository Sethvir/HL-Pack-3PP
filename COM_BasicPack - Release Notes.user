<strong>v3.0  January 1, 2015</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed all the "Weapon CMB" and "Weapon CMD" adjustments to better display weapon specific bonuses for Disarm, Sunder, and Trip attacks.</li>
<li>Changed "Hero, Ability score increase" adjustment to allow negative numbers.</li>
</ul>

<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added "Mythic Ability, Add Trackable" to force a mythic ability to display on the In-Play tab.</li>
<li>Added "Mythic Ability, Remove Tracker" to remove a mythic ability from displaying on the In-Play tab.</li>
<li>Added "Improved Weapon Finesse" feat that requires the feat "Weapon Finesse" and gives "Dex" to damage with light and finesse weapons.</li>
<li>Added "Bolt Ace" archetype. This version of the Bolt Ace loses all access to guns and gains access to all crossbows. In addition the bolt ace loses Gunsmithing and gains Rapid Reload at first level.</li>
<li>Added "Superstition" rage power that can be activated on the In-Play tab. This makes it easier to keep track of all those Morale bonus stacking issues.</li>
<li>Added "Deal Nonlethal Dmg (-4H)" combat action so that the -4H is easily taken into account and all weapons will show they do "nonlethal" damage.</li>
<li>Added "Combat: Flanking Bonus" allows you to increase/decrease the flanking bonus condition. This is a "Conferred Ability Adjustment" and is used to help those with Outflank feats or Menacing weapon property.</li>
<li>Added "Armor Razors" which are like spiked armor but do slashing damage instead of piercing damage.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tagged custom feats, equipment, and archetypes to be non-PFS legal.</li>
</ul>
